This legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  An unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  This really took me by surprise ÛÒ the fact that the ACA could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  That would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  Simply put: This is a public safety issue.  IÛªve been concerned that since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  I sent the IRS a letter in November requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  Under the Employer Mandate Provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  This could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in Pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  Fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    Some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ÛÏWell, weÛªve only got 25 volunteers so weÛªre safe.  We donÛªt have fifty.Û That may not necessarily be the case.  Some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  That could mean that if you take the number of firefighters ÛÒ paid and unpaid ÛÒ now considered employees by the IRS, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.Û",Republican

Lewallen was born in the 11th District town of Blackwell in 1919.  He rode roughstock in rodeos from 1936 until retiring in 1956.   Along the way he competed in rodeo's in Madison Square Garden and married Rockettes dancer Ethel Spanier.  G.K. and Ethel opened what is now Chick Elms Rodeo Shop and Grand Entry Western Store in Stephenville.  In a story in the Stephenville Empire Tribune, Suzi Robertson remembered his generosity the year she entered a rodeo queen contest.  ÛÏI went into his store and picked out a new white hat and white pearlized boots,"" Robertson said. ""When I went to the register to pay, he told me I owed him nothing, but to do my best. What an encouragement to a teenager.

Tarleton State University will be showing the film tomorrow and the public is invited to watch it.  Lt. Col. Dyess was a Tarleton State graduate and an American hero in WWII.  While fighting the Japanese on the island of Bataan, outnumbered and under equipped, Dyess and his comrades surrendered to the enemies on April 10, 1942, and were marched to a prisoner-of-war camp in the infamous ÛÏBataan Death March.Û Nearly a year later, Dyess and nine other American prisoners-of-war, along with two Filipino convicts broke out of the Davao Penal Colony, an escape-proof Imperial Japanese Army prison plantation in the Philippines.  Lt. Col Dyess was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross and Distinguished Service Cross, for his valor.  He died on Dec. 22, 1943 in Burbank, Calif., when he chose to pilot his P-38, which had caught fire, away from a heavily populated area, rather than parachuting to safety.  He landed the plane in a vacant lot, where it exploded on impact and killed him. The movie will be shown in in Room 116 of the O.A. Grant Humanities Building at Tarleton State.

In the days before refrigeration, salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather. The Bluffton-Tow Salt Works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the Confederacy.  During the war, every day the residents of Tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt.  In 1852, David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, were the first settlers in the area. Local Indians showed them salt beds near the Colorado River, which they developed into saltworks.  A year later, John F. Morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area.  They established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally.  William and Wilson Tow also moved to the area in 1853 and  named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley.

Earlier this month he gave an expanded version of that lecture.  In the lecture, he said that for Thomas Jefferson the most important goals of education were civic and moral.   Kagan said, ""This was not meant to be a 'value free' exercise; on the contrary, its purpose was to communicate the special virtues of republican representative democracy, the dangers that threatened it, and the responsibility of its citizens to esteem and protect it. This education was to be a common experience for all citizens, rich and poor, for every one of them had natural rights and powers, and every one had to understand and esteem the institutions, laws and traditions of his country if it was to succeed.""",Republican

Much remains unknown about these events as of today and the Congress is beginning a debate on the issue.  My constituents are deeply concerned about events in Syria and they are searching for an appropriate response which will end the killing and move quickly toward a political solution to the war in Syria.  However they are overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. military intervention of any kind.  They are concerned about the morality of such action, they are concerned about the legality of such action, they are concerned about the loss of life resulting from such action, they are concerned about the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of such action, they are concerned about such action involving us more deeply in the Civil War in Syria, they are concerned about what follow on conflict such action might trigger, they are concerned about sabotaging a possible agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, they are concerned about the drawing resources and focus from critical immediate problems here at home.  I share all of those concerns and more.  I have been, and remain today, a staunch support of President Obama.  However, my first responsibility as a Member of Congress is to represent the interests and views of my constituents.

I think this comment from him sums up exactly what I mean (throwing Clapper under the bus along the way):  'Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper,' Obama said, 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.'  But in reality, the Administration was warned all along about the rise of ISIS/ISIL.  Defense Intelligence Director, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had warned President Obama and repeated that info to Congress:  From the attached article:  'By February [2014] we had generals basically reading out their memos to Congress,' he added, referring to testimony from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn predicted ISIS 'probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.' The Islamist terror group had already seized Fallujah and Ramadi, he said, had the 'ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.' By the time Flynn spoke on Capitol Hill, Congress had already heard the story at least once before. Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in November 2013 that ISIS had been militarily active all year because of 'a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, poor operational tactics, and popular grievances, which remain unaddressed.' 'It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,' McGurk said.",Republican

In fact, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years! We need to focus on creating an environment where innovation, small business, and entrepreneurship can thrive.    That means removing roadblocks to job creation like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank and  making America more energy independent.  At the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people ""left behind"" by the government's calculation.   Read more from The Associated Press:  The drop in the unemployment rate in August to a 4å_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate ÛÓ the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one ÛÓ to 63.2 percent. It's the lowest participation rate since August 1978.  Once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. That's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-fewer-working-age-americans-are-working",Republican

 This is the first time the Jamboree has been held in the Mountain State, and the event brought nearly 50,000 Scouts, leaders, volunteers and others to the new site.  The first Boy Scout Jamboree took place in 1937 in Washington, D.C.
 
 ÛÏAs an Eagle Scout, I could not be more proud that my home state of West Virginia is hosting the Jamboree and will serve as the permanent home for the event in the coming years,Û said Rep. McKinley.  ÛÏThis week, thousands of Scouts from around the United States, their leaders and others have travelled to the new facility near the New River Gorge to celebrate Scouting and participate in activities to build leadership and character.Û
 
 The site, known as the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, will house Scouts, staff and adult leaders, who will enjoy the outdoors and test their abilities in a number of ways.  
 
 Rep. McKinleyÛªs office also helped in sending 90-year-old Carlyle Farnsworth, a Wheeling resident, to this yearÛªs Jamboree.  Farnsworth is also an Eagle Scout and attended the first jamboree back in 1937.

325642654132598_773680455995480,"Yesterday I introduced legislation to jumpstart the economy, grow the middle class, and fight income inequality. Read the press release below to find out more:  (WASHINGTON, DC / January 27, 2014): Congressman Richard E. Neal, Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Subcommittee, last week introduced legislation to jumpstart the sluggish economy, finance critical infrastructure investments, fight income inequality and create jobs.  The Invest in US Act, extends and reauthorizes key bond measures beneficial for our states and municipalities, extends several critical tax credit initiatives, sets up an infrastructure bank, increases the minimum wage and provides small businesses with tax relief.  ""Right now the U.S. economy is stuck in a rut, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the growing income inequality in America threatens to derail our economy altogether,""  Neal said.  ""In December 2013, we saw the economy only add 74,000 jobs, our lowest since 2011.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 2013 the economy averaged adding 183,000 jobs a month.  At this current rate, the Federal Reserve says the unemployment rate will remain above 6.5 percent until 2015.  This is simply unacceptable, and America can do better, and we must.   The recession has wiped out 8 million jobs, and it is imperative that we get them back.  That is why I introduced the Invest in US Act.  This legislation will go a long way in creating an environment where our economy can take off by making the strategic investment needed to spur growth.  Furthermore, the legislation takes full aim at the growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage, while also providing tax relief for businesses that hire new employees and buy new equipment."" Below please find a summary of the legislation.  The Invest in US Act at a glance: Tax Provisions Û¢ New Markets Tax Credit ÛÒExtends and expands the New Markets Tax Credit program.  The New Markets Tax Credit program is made permanent, with an allocation amount of $5 billion annually.  By permanently extending the NMTC, the legislation ensures that communities will continue to receive investments they need to renew, rebuild and refurbish neighborhoods for generations to come. Û¢ Build America Bonds (BABs) ÛÒ Makes the BABs program permanent, starting with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2013, and phasing down to a 28 percent subsidy rate in 2017 and thereafter.  BABs unleash job creation, economic growth and spur private-sector investments in infrastructure.  From the inception of the program in April 2009 to when it expired at the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate BABs issues, which supported more than $181 billion of financing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as schools, bridges and hospitals. Û¢ Research and Development Tax Credit. Makes permanent and expands the R&D Tax Credit.  The legislation also increases the the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) from 14 to 17 percent. Û¢ AMT repeal on Private Activity Bonds ÛÒ Eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on private activity bonds (PABs).  PABs are a form of municipal bonds that are used by a variety of public and non-profit entities such as airports, seaports and student loan issuers.  The AMT penalty attached to these bonds results in higher interest rates which correlate to higher infrastructure project costs and higher student loan rate burdens. Û¢ Facility Water & Sewer Bonds ÛÒ Exempts water and sewer projects from the private activity bond (PAB) cap.  Currently, the tax code limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond debt that can be issued annually in a state.  The legislation excludes the PABs issued by water and sewage facilities from the state volume cap.  Removing the volume cap makes additional private investment capital available for these types of infrastructure facilities. Û¢ Work Opportunity Tax Credit. - Makes the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) permanent.  The tax credit expired at the end of 2013.  The WOTC provides a federal tax credit up to $9,600 for businesses that hire targeted individuals.  Since 1996, the WOTC has expired numerous times.  Making the credit permanent will end the uncertainty surrounding the credit for employers and potential hires. Û¢ Jobs Training Tax Credit.  The legislation incorporates Senator Menendez's common sense proposal that links community colleges with local businesses to train employees.  Like Senator Menendez's proposal, this bill provides $1 billion in funding for a competitive tax-credit initiative that encourages colleges and businesses to form job-training partnerships.  The proposal also would provide a community college tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to any U.S. based business that trains a long-term unemployed person for an open job that requires a certain type of certificate or other training credential. Û¢ Extends Increased Business Expensing.  This provision permanently extends the 2013 section 179 expensing and investment limitations of $500,000 and $2 million.  This provision is effective for qualifying property placed in service after December 31, 2013. Û¢ Permanent of the 15-Year Depreciation Schedule. Makes permanent the 15-year depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements, restaurant improvements and new construction, and retail improvements.  Currently this is a temporary provision that must be extended annually.  By making this provision permanent we are providing businesses with the certainty they need to undertake capital expenditures, which fuel economic activity and create jobs.  Other Provisions Û¢ Infrastructure Bank.  In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United State's infrastructure a grade of D+ and estimated that the US will need to invest an additional $1.6 trillion to fix our infrastructure.  The Invest in US Act creates the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA), which is an independent, wholly-owned government infrastructure bank, to assist in funding some of the critical infrastructure needs.  Under the proposal, Department of Treasury will make available $10 billion in seed money to encourage private investment in public works projects.  It is estimated that this self- sustaining entity could be capable of leveraging as much as $625 billion in private investment by issuing direct loans, loan guarantees, bonds and debt securities.  To keep both the costs and risks low, the AIFA is also barred from financing more than 50 percent of any one project. Increase in Minimum Wage.  The legislation increases the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25.  This increase is phased in over four years and in three increments of 95 cents.  Thereafter, the minimum wage will increase as the cost of living increases.",Democrat

In the meantime, the area has been closed off to all personnel. Additional environmental and medical evaluations are expected in about a week. 
 
 The affected bunker and other nearby bunkers were once used to assemble nuclear bomb sections. They are currently used to store equipment for National Guard units that are preparing for deployment.

460776160654909_500834823315709,"Today, the Senate introduced a plan for comprehensive immigration reform.   The plan is a tremendous step toward fixing our broken immigration system and strengthening El Paso.  For the first time in over three decades, Congress has the opportunity to pass a serious comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has the support of a broad coalition of leaders, including members of both parties and business, labor, and immigration advocacy groups. It goes a long way in addressing critical concerns- it creates a path to citizenship for immigrants that pay their taxes, obey our laws and learn English. It also helps reunite broken families, gives young DREAMers an opportunity to pursue their goals and directs resources towards securing our border.  El Paso will be uniquely impacted by whatever bill Congress passes and I am committed to making sure our voice is heard in this debate. Our community has long dealt with the consequences of both long wait times at our ports and immigration laws that break up families and ignore economic conditions. I look forward to reviewing the entire bill more in depth, but it is a great first step to fixing our immigration system. I hope that Congress rises to the challenge and passes comprehensive immigration reform this year.  For a full copy of my statement, click on the link below.",Democrat

But I cannot support a plan that increases our nationÛªs debt by half a TRILLION dollars while offering no spending reforms. WashingtonÛªs addiction to spending is what led to this mess, and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach.  A better way forward would be honest, simple legislation that (1) takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms, (2) provides temporary government funding, and (3) allows us time to work toward a real budget. I know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would ultimately support such a plan. The problem is the Û÷shutdown strategyÛª damaged the HouseÛªs bargaining power in these negotiations.  I hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular Americans: striving to protect Americans from ObamaCareÛªs harmful mandates and taxes, setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit, and pushing a pro-growth agenda that will help create jobs for people in Alabama and throughout the country. http://www.wsfa.com/story/23711725/rep-roby-to-vote-no-on",Republican

We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress.Û (5/19/08)  ÛÏComprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. Û_ Anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.Û (5/5/10)  ÛÏ[T]here are those in the immigrantsÛª rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. And it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally. Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship.  And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.Û (7/1/10)  ÛÏI do have an obligation to make sure that I am following some of the rules. I can't simply ignore laws that are out there. I've got to work to make sure that they are changed.Û (10/14/10)  ÛÏI am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've got to have some partners to do it. Û_ The main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. Û_ [T]he most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works ÛÒ again, I just want to repeat, I'm president, I'm not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. But there's a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws.Û (10/25/10)  ÛÏAmerica is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. Û_ With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, thatÛªs just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed Û_. [W]eÛªve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branchÛªs job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.Û (3/28/11)  ÛÏI can't solve this problem by myself. Û_ [W]e're going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. Û_ I can't do it by myself. We're going to have to change the laws in Congress, but I'm confident we can make it happen.Û (4/20/11)  ÛÏI know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.  But thatÛªs not how democracy works.  See, democracy is hard.  But itÛªs right. Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.Û (4/29/11)  ÛÏSometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But thatÛªs not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what IÛªm committed to doing.Û (5/10/11)  ÛÏI swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books Û_. Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. ThatÛªs not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.Û (7/25/11)  ÛÏSo what weÛªve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books, weÛªve tried to be as fair, humane, just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves need to be changed. Û_ The most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws, weÛªve got to get it through the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by Republicans, and weÛªve got to get 60 votes in the Senate. Û_ Administratively, we can't ignore the law. Û_ I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.  We are doing everything we can administratively.  But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.  And I think thereÛªs been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things.  ItÛªs just not true. Û_ We live in a democracy.  You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.  And if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. We have to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, we can get this thing solved.Û (9/28/11)  In June 2012, President Obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA), allowing ÛÏeligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety Û_ to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.Û He then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own:  ÛÏNow, what IÛªve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, thereÛªs a limit to what I can do. Part of the reason that deportations went up was Congress put a whole lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be higher numbers. What weÛªve said is, letÛªs make sure that youÛªre not misdirecting those resources. But weÛªre still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally. And thatÛªs why this continues to be a top priority of mine. Û_ And we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. But until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, weÛªre going to continue to be bound by the law. Û_ And so part of the challenge as President is constantly saying, Û÷what authorities do I have?ÛªÛ (9/20/12)  ÛÏWe are a nation of immigrants. Û_ But we're also a nation of laws. So what I've said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. And I've done everything that I can on my own[.]Û (10/16/12)  ÛÏI'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law.Û (1/30/13)  ÛÏIÛªm not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.  And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, weÛªve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we canÛªt simply ignore the law. When it comes to the dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, Û÷These folks are generally not a risk. TheyÛªre not involved in crime. Û_ And so letÛªs prioritize our enforcement resources.Ûª But to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do. This is why we need comprehensive immigration reform. To make sure that once and for all, in a way that is, you know, ratified by Congress, we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, whoÛªve put down roots here. Û_ My job is to carry out the law. And so Congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. They give us an order that weÛªve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books.  Û_ If this was an issue that I could do unilaterally I would have done it a long time ago. Û_ The way our system works is Congress has to pass legislation. I then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it.Û (1/30/13)  ÛÏThis is something IÛªve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that IÛªm the president of the United States, IÛªm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic.Û (2/14/13)  ÛÏI think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. Û_ And weÛªve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people Û_. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively.Û (7/16/13)  ÛÏMy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said Û÷here is the lawÛª when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. And, what I have been able to do is to make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress has asked us to do. What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. Û_ But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option. Û_ What I've said is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress.Û (9/17/13)  ÛÏ[I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But weÛªre also a nation of laws. ThatÛªs part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what IÛªm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. Û_ It is not simply a matter of us just saying weÛªre going to violate the law. ThatÛªs not our tradition. The great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out.Û (11/25/13)  ÛÏI am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive immigration reform. But what IÛªve said in the past remains true, which is until Congress passes a new law, then I am constrained in terms of what I am able to do. What IÛªve done is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you canÛªt enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people, there arenÛªt the resources there.  What weÛªve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on people who are engaged in gang activity. Do not focus on young people, who weÛªre calling DREAMers Û_. That already stretched my administrative capacity very far. But I was confident that that was the right thing to do. But at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is, Congress said, Û÷you have to enforce these laws.Ûª They fund the hiring of officials at the department thatÛªs charged with enforcing.  And I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore, you know, any of the other laws that are on the books. ThatÛªs why itÛªs so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year.Û (3/6/14)  ÛÏI think that I never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power].  IÛªm bound by the Constitution; IÛªm bound by separation of powers.  There are some things we canÛªt do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. Û_ Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I donÛªt have a green light. Û_ My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but itÛªs going to be longer-lasting.Û (8/6/14)",Republican

 by: TIDINGS PHOTO: VERN UYETAKE - U.S. Navy veterans Marlyn Miller and Daniel Larsen spoke to U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader on Veterans Day about their exposure to toxic chemicals while in the service. 
 
 When Daniel Larsen stood up to speak at a mid-October town hall meeting hosted by U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader, it wasnÛªt to voice a complaint about the recent government shutdown or to discuss second amendment rights. 
 
 The issue he brought forward was very specific, one that he and scores of other Navy veterans had dealt with for years, yet remained unknown to officials like Schrader.
